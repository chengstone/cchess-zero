All nodes of the current node can be obtained, and the information N of each child node can be obtained, and then select one from multiple actions. This is actually a multi-classification problem. We use softmax to get the probability of choosing an action. What is passed to softmax is the logits of each action ($N(s_0,a) ^{1/τ}$), which can actually be changed to $1/τ * log( N(s_0,a))$.

In the self-play game, a new trained neural network is used to make predictions. MCTS and neural networks have me in you and you in me. Repeated iterations will make the network predictions more accurate and the MCTS results more powerful. In fact, the prediction of neural network can be understood as human intuition."

Learning to play chess from chaotic experience requires a lot of games. The solution space is very sparse, equivalent to 100 data, 99 are negative examples, and only 1 positive example. In the paper, mini-batch was trained 700K times, and [`chess-alpha-zero`](https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero), an open source chess project, was also trained 10K times. As for me, I have trained less than 4K times. The model has just learned to defend with elephants and warriors. In short, I still play chess badly. If you have the conditions, you can try more training. I have taken aws offline since I received the 400 USD credit card charge notification: D Poverty limits my imagination O(∩_∩)O"
